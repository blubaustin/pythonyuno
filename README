Work in progress to give XP for VC and move Yuno away from java script. Bot was started by Jared but he decided to drop the project
before finishing the project. And I quote "It would only take me 30 minutes to finish what you need"~Jared but yet he wouldn't
just finish it. So best we can do is just add to the code and use the JS Yuno for the rest of the bot.

Remember this bot is under the AGPL so you need to publish your source/changed. Easiest way is to for the bot and just publish
on your own git. 

Dependencies: python 3.7+, pillow
