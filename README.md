Work in progress to give XP for VC and move Yuno away from java script.

Remember this bot is under the AGPL so you need to publish your source/changed. Easiest way is to for the bot and just publish
on your own git.

Todo::
* XP system(VC done)
* Assignable Ban Images
* Ban via ID/name
* REGEX spam filter ported to python
* Source command to comply with AGPL that links to the github
* Assignable welcome message /w mention of commands
* Channel cleaning like JS Yuno does
